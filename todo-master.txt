2 word names: Should not be any problems

multi-word names:

- search individually for all the words and choose the instance with most #words in the vicinity

	Ex Rahul Shankar Bhardwaj: Search separately for 'Rahul', 'Shankar' & 'Bhardwaj' and finally choose that instance with these names most closeby 
	(or not separated by a '\n' character)

- slightly brute-force algo:
	Search for all permutations and combinations of a given name. 
	Ex: For 'Rahul Shankar Bhardwaj', 
	We will search for: 3C2*2! + 3P3 kinds of search strings
	'Rahul Shankar', 'Shankar Rahul'
	'Shankar Bhardwaj', 'Bhardwaj Shankar'
	'Rahul Bhardwaj', 'Bhardwaj Rahul'

	'Rahul Shankar Bhardwaj', 'Shankar Rahul Bhardwaj', 'Shankar Bhardwaj Rahul', 'Rahul Bhardwaj Shankar', 'Bhardwaj Shankar Rahul', 'Bhardwaj Rahul Shankar'
